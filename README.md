# Getting Started with App

`Node Version: 18`

#### Environment Setup

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` in Backend Folder. All the required variables are present there.


#### Local Development Setup

Use git clone to get a local copy. If you've already got a local copy, make sure you've got the main branch's latest changes using git pull. Then run npm install in the root directory to install the dependencies:

```
git@github.com:developer-mindpath/MrsWordsmith-Technical-Test.git
cd mrsmith-test
npm install 
npm run nodemon -- This will up local development server
```
